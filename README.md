 :gear: A tool for creating and manipulating SVG vectors. :gear:
## Overview
![alt text](./public/assets/SVGTINKER.png)
 SVGs are one of the coolest formats out there. The amount of flexiblility and customization that SVGs offer provide us an endless amount creative possiblities. ...But have you ever looked at SVG HTML code? It's quiet daunting to say the least. (Even with the simplest of vector images)

 Hence the focus of this tool is for it to not only act as canvas for creative ideas but also as a compelling educational tool for engineers who want to learn about the anatomy of SVG.

## How to Use
 Use the control panel on the left side of the screen to manipulate the cooresponding vertices of a shape. To add another shape to your SVG click the "add new shape" button above the control panel. To remove a particular shape click the "-" icon located at the top right of every shape in the control panel.

## Planned features
#### [✔] Add and removal of Path vertices (Each path has 4 currently)
#### [✖] Enable the Path SVGs to also be relatively positioned(Each path is currently using only absolute postioned vertices)   
#### [✖] Enable support for SVG: lines, circles, elipses, polygons, polylines, text, dropshadows, blur effects and filters   
```
     [✔] Circles
     [✔] Elipses
     [✔] Paths
     [✔] Lines
     [✔] Text
     [✔] Rectagles
     [✖] Polygons
     [✖] Polylines
     [✖] Filters

```
#### [✖] Enable shape layer heirachy
#### [✖] Enable user to live code SVG
#### [✖] Enable user to import and render svg code (including default or starter shapes like stars or stairs)
#### [✖] Implement Undo/Redo changes made
#### [✖] Implement copy and paste || or Duplicate shape feature
#### [✖] Enable shape-highlighting on activation (lets user know what they are manipulating)
#### [✖] Refactor and refine UI
#### [✖] Enable user to store SVGs/ save  in DB/localstorage etc  
#### [✖] Adding math tools(ex: user can proportionally resize svgs or translate its position)
