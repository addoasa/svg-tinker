#  :gear: A tool for creating and manipulating SVG vectors. :gear:

## Overview
#### SVGs are one of the coolest formats out there. The amount of flexiblility and customization that SVGs offer provide us an endless amount creative possiblities. ...But have you ever looked at SVG HTML code? It's quiet daunting to say the least. (Even with the simplest of vector images)

#### Hence the focus of this tool is for it to not only act as canvas for creative ideas but also as a compelling educational tool for engineers who want to learn about the anatomy of SVG.

## How to Use
#### Use the control panel on the left side of the screen to manipulate the cooresponding vertices of a shape. To add another shape to your SVG click the "add new shape" button above the control panel. To remove a particular shape click the "-" icon located at the top right of every shape in the control panel.
